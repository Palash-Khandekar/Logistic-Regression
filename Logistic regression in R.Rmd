This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
dataset = read.csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
head(dataset)
```
UserID and Gender are not the variables we would need for prediction.
```{r}
dataset = dataset[3:5]
head(dataset)
```
```{r}
#Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split = sample.split(dataset$Purchased, SplitRatio = 0.75)
training_set = subset(dataset, split == TRUE)
test_set = subset(dataset, split == FALSE)

```
Feature Scaling
```{r}
training_set[-3] = scale(training_set[-3])
test_set[-3] = scale(test_set[-3])
```
Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
```{r}
classifier = glm(formula = Purchased ~ .,
                 family = binomial,
                 data = training_set)
summary(classifier)
```
All variables are 99.9% and higher statistically significant.

Lets now predict the Test set results
```{r}
prob_pred = predict(classifier, type = 'response', newdata = test_set[-3])
head(prob_pred,35)
```
The above matrix shows the probabilities of buying car.
For e.g. user 2 has a probability of 1.6% of buying a car, we can classify this user in the category of not buying.
user 104 has a probability of 76.49, this user comes in the category of buying car.

Lets classify this users as below:
if the probability is more than 0.5 lets classify the user into buying category else into not buying category
```{r}
y_pred = ifelse(prob_pred > 0.5,1,0)
head(y_pred,35)
```

Evaluating the performance of the model using confusion matrix
```{r}
cm = table(test_set[,3], y_pred)
cm
```
56+26 ---> correct predictions
10+7 ---> incorrect predictions
```{r}
accuracy = (57+26)/(56+7+10+26)
accuracy
```
### Visualization
```{r}
install.packages('ElemStatLearn')
library(ElemStatLearn)

```
#### Visualising the Training set results
```{r}
set = training_set
X1 = seq(min(set[, 1]) - 1, max(set[, 1]) + 1, by = 0.01)
X2 = seq(min(set[, 2]) - 1, max(set[, 2]) + 1, by = 0.01)
grid_set = expand.grid(X1, X2)
colnames(grid_set) = c('Age', 'EstimatedSalary')
prob_set = predict(classifier, type = 'response', newdata = grid_set)
y_grid = ifelse(prob_set > 0.5, 1, 0)
plot(set[, -3],
     main = 'Logistic Regression (Training set)',
     xlab = 'Age', ylab = 'Estimated Salary',
     xlim = range(X1), ylim = range(X2))
contour(X1, X2, matrix(as.numeric(y_grid), length(X1), length(X2)), add = TRUE)
points(grid_set, pch = '.', col = ifelse(y_grid == 1, 'springgreen3', 'tomato'))
points(set, pch = 21, bg = ifelse(set[, 3] == 1, 'green4', 'red3'))
```
