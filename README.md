### Predicting who buys car using Logistic Regression

In this project, I am making a Logistic Regression model to predict the users who may buy  car. The variables for prediction are "Age" and "Salary" of the users. I have split the data into training and testing set in the ratio 3:1. 
This model can be used by business to target their advertisements to group of users.
